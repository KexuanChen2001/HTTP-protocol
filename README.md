Our project simulates a web server and the HTTP protocol, allowing access through a Request and then obtaining a corresponding Response, such as 'HTTP/1.0 404 File Not Found' or 'HTTP/1.0 200 OK'. Specifically, the server waits to listen and accept connections, reads and parses requests, searches for the file, creates a response header, and then responds with the file. The browser sends a request and receives a response, then displays the file. Our project features a user-friendly UI, enabling the download of multimedia files through a URL, including text, PDFs, videos, audio, and images. Resources can also be accessed via the website (from the browser button). URL encryption is used to implement access permissions; only those with a password-inclusive URL can access the corresponding encrypted files. Additionally, we maintain logs to record history records.
